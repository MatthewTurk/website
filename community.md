Why Community?
==============

The yt project views community engagement, community involvement and
community growth as absolutely essential to the health and success of a
scientific software project. We have [deliberately
worked](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7064) to grow a helpful, sustainable
community of peers and contributors.

There are many ways to find information, ask for assistance, contribute
code or scripts, or even just meet people involved with the project.

Mailing Lists and Bug Reports
=============================

There are three primary mailing lists for yt, each of which caters to a
different area of interest. These are probably the single best way to
get help with someone, to suggest a feature, or to discuss anything with
other yt users.

-   [yt-users](https://mail.python.org/mm3/mailman3/lists/yt-users.python.org/)
    for usage help, questions and answers, and general discussion.
-   [yt-dev](https://mail.python.org/mm3/mailman3/lists/yt-dev.python.org/)
    for development-related discussions.

yt also has a bug tracker which you can
[browse](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/issues/) or
[create](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/issues/new) new issues inside.
This is a good way to report a problem that is definitely a problem with
yt, so that it doesn\'t get lost and will be addressed.

Chatting on IRC and Slack
=========================

On [FreeNode](https://freenode.org/) there is a channel called
[\#yt]{.code} for chatting with other yt users. You can join IRC using
Adium, IRSSI, X-chat or any other IRC client by connecting to
chat.freenode.org. Feel free to stop by, say hello, or ask questions \--
you don\'t need to have a problem with yt to come by and chat!

In case you don\'t have an IRC client, we also have a [web
client](https://yt-project.org/irc.html) that will connect you directly
to our channel.

We also hang out and chat about development on
[slack](https://yt-project.slack.com). If you would like to join us,
please send us your name and email to get an invitation using the button
on the right.

If nobody answers your question right away, it might just mean that
nobody is around right then. Usually the channel is the busiest during
the day, US time. Go ahead and ask, and when somebody sees and is able
to answer, they probably will!

Sharing Scripts, Projects and Notebooks
=======================================

The [yt Data Hub](https://hub.yt/) is designed to be a place to
facilitate easy sharing of data, projects of interest to others, as well
as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). For very short form items,
we also provide a [pastebin](https://paste.yt-project.org/).

Social Networking
=================

yt has a presence on [twitter](https://twitter.com/yt_astro), where
occasional updates are posted. Other places for short-form updates
include the [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ytproject), and the
[Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/107728486871834552760), where
occasionally hangouts, videos and live office hours are held.

yt also has a [blog](https://blog.yt-project.org/), where longer-form
content can be found. The blog itself is open for submissions \-- all
you have to do is visit the [blog
repository](https://github.com/yt-project/blog), fork, and issue a pull
request! We\'d love to have your submissions of papers you\'ve recently
published with yt, interesting tips and tricks, or anything else that
others might be interested in.

yt Community Code of Conduct
============================

The community of participants in open source Scientific projects is made
up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills,
personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our
community experiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone
in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others
both inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a
positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community.

As members of the community,

-   We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment-
    and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation
    and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size,
    race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual
    language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary
    jokes are not appropriate.
-   We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing
    acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we
    pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or
    acknowledged.
-   We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and
    realize that including people with a variety of opinions and
    backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular,
    discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies,
    programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be
    done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all
    participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely
    express their opinions.
-   We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying
    particular attention to those new to the community. We pledge to
    provide respectful criticisms and feedback in forums, especially in
    discussion threads resulting from code contributions.
-   We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider
    community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive
    to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and
    disagreement, both within our community and where we are criticized.
    We will treat those outside our community with the same respect as
    people within our community.
-   We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct,
    and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of
    conduct. We will take action when members of our community violate
    this code such as contacting confidential\@yt-project.org (all
    emails sent to this address will be treated with the strictest
    confidence) or talking privately with the person.

This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and
offline, including mailing lists, forums, social media, conferences,
meetings, associated social events, and one-to-one interactions.

The yt Community Code of Conduct was adapted from the [Astropy Community
Code of Conduct](https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html), which
was partially inspired by the PSF code of conduct.
