  content: >
    Cameron began work on the yt project in 2010.  The focus of his code
    contributions have been on halo finding, tracking, and merger trees; volume
    rendering and the camera interface, synthetic spectral generation, and the
    graphical user interface for yt, Reason, but he has experience making
    modifications in many corners of the codebase.  Cameron has organized and
    written a large fraction of the yt documentation and has contributed
    numerous useful recipes to the cookbook.  As the informal documentation
    czar, he tries very hard to assure newly developed functionality is
    accessible to the entire userbase.  He is active in yt project organization
    and planning.
- name: Suoqing Ji
  since: 2014
  content: >
    Suoqing has benefited a lot from friendly yt community.  The 2012 user
    workshop made him stick to yt for analyzing his FLASH datasets, and the
    2014 development workshop made him into a developer. He has contributed to
    improvement of plotting functionality and extension of volume rendering.
    Suoqing started his PhD at UC Santa Babara in 2013, where he also
    collaborates with local researchers to incorporate yt into the AlloSphere
    for real-time analysis of astrophysical datasets with stereoscopic 3-D
    virtual reality.
