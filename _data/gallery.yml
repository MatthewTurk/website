    In <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.468.4107R">Ruggiero
    & Lima Neto (2017)</a>, the authors used yt to do all the analysis
    and visualization of their data. This figure shows gas density
    projections of a Milky Way like galaxy falling into a galaxy cluster
    with different entry speeds, for the case where the cluster has
    a cool-core (first three rows) or does not have a cool-core (last
    three rows).

    This movie was completely scripted in <a
    href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> using the AstroBlend python
    library, freely available artistic 3D galaxy models and yt-generated
    surfaces of a FLASH simulation.  AstroBlend tutorials and examples are
    available on <a href="http://www.astroblend.com/">the AstroBlend
    website</a>, which is still very much under construction.  Paper due out at
    some point in the (hopefully) near future.

    This movie was created completely with yt by Matthew Turk, John Wise, Sam
    Skillman, and Mark SubbaRao that shows a zoom-out of a collapsing
    metal-free halo and then transitions to another simulation that follows the
    main sequence and supernova of a metal-free star.  The simulation shown in
    the first half was presented in <a
    href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009Sci...325..601T">Turk et al.
    (2009)</a> and the latter simulation will be published shortly.  This
    visualization won the Best Visualization Award at the <a
    href="http://www.xsede.org/web/xsede13/">XSEDE 13</a> conference and was
    exhibited at the Alder Planetarium.

    This multi-panel figure, created with the eps_writer extension, highlights
    the magnitude and direction of the acceleration created by radiation
    pressure from massive stars in a dwarf galaxy at redshift 8.  This
    simulation was presented in <a
    href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.427..311W">Wise et al.
    (2012)</a> and conducted with <a href="http://enzo-project.org">Enzo</a>.
    The bottom panels show the density, temperature, and metallicity of the
    same slice.  This figure was published in the reference above as Figure 9.

    This movie shows the density and temperature structure around a forming
    protostar that is surrounded by an accretion disk and driving a bipolar
    outflow. The simulation was carried out by S. Offner with the ORION code,
    the temperature was computed by T. Robitaille with the <a
    href="http://www.hyperion-rt.org/">Hyperion</a> radiative transfer code and
    the visualization was produced in Python using yt and matplotlib.
