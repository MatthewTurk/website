          <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
          <p>
            The yt project aims to produce an integrated science environment for
            collaboratively asking and answering astrophysical questions. To do
            so, it will encompass the creation of initial conditions, the
            execution of simulations, and the detailed exploration and
            visualization of the resultant data. It will also provide a standard
            framework based on physical quantities interoperability between codes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Development of yt is driven by a commitment to Open Science principles
            as manifested in participatory development, reproducibility,
            documented and approachable code, a friendly and helpful community of
            users and developers, and Free and Libre Open Source Software.

          <h1>What has yt been used for?</h1>
          <p>
            Analysis and visualization using yt has been applied to many
            different problems within Astrophysics.  For a few places yt has
            been applied, see the 
            <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-ref_query?bibcode=2011ApJS..192....9T&amp;refs=CITATIONS&amp;db_key=AST">list of citations</a> to the

          <p>
            A few of the more fun things yt has been used for include the cover
            of the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v499/n7459/index.html">July 25, 2013</a> issue of Nature (and the accompanying

	    by Nathan Goldbaum about yt-3.0 and
  
            at <a href="http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013">SciPy 2013</a>
            by Sam Skillman describing how

          <p>The community of participants in open source
          Scientific projects is made up of members from around the
          globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and
          experiences. It is through these differences that our
          community experiences success and continued growth. We
          expect everyone in our community to follow these guidelines
          when interacting with others both inside and outside of our
          community. Our goal is to keep ours a positive, inclusive,
          successful, and growing community.</p>
          <p>As members of the community,
            <ul>
              <li>We pledge to treat all people with respect and
                provide a harassment- and bullying-free environment,
                regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or gender
                identity, disability, physical appearance, body size,
                race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In
                particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist,
                racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not
                appropriate.</li>

              <li>We pledge to respect the work of others by
                recognizing acknowledgment/citation requests of
                original authors. As authors, we pledge to be explicit
                about how we want our own work to be cited or
                acknowledged.</li>

              <li>We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the
                community, and realize that including people with a
                variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to
                enrich our community. In particular, discussions
                relating to pros/cons of various technologies,
                programming languages, and so on are welcome, but
                these should be done with respect, taking proactive
                measure to ensure that all participants are heard and
                feel confident that they can freely express their
                opinions.</li>

              <li>We pledge to welcome questions and answer them
                respectfully, paying particular attention to those new
                to the community. We pledge to provide respectful
                criticisms and feedback in forums, especially in
                discussion threads resulting from code
                contributions.</li>

              <li>We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of
                the wider community and to respond to criticism
                respectfully. We will strive to model behaviors that
                encourage productive debate and disagreement, both
                within our community and where we are criticized. We
                will treat those outside our community with the same
                respect as people within our community.</li>

              <li>We pledge to help the entire community follow the
              code of conduct, and to not remain silent when we see
              violations of the code of conduct. We will take action
              when members of our community violate this code such as
              contacting confidential@yt-project.org (all emails sent to
              this address will be treated with the strictest
              confidence) or talking privately with the person.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>This code of conduct applies to all
