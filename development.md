Development
===========

yt is developed completely in the open. Our
[project](https://github.com/yt-project) on GitHub contains the
repositories that make up the [source code and
documentation](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/), and even [this
website](https://github.com/yt-project/website). Since the documentation
is in the source code repository, when you download the source, you get
everything necessary to submit changes to the code or the docs. yt is
released under the modified BSD license.

We invite contributions of any type \-- code, analysis modules,
documentation, blog posts, and even enhancements for the website. Below
are some hints on what to expect and how to get involved, but please
stop by [the yt-dev mailing
list](https://mail.python.org/mm3/mailman3/lists/yt-dev.python.org/) or
[\#yt]{.yt_code} on [chat.freenode.org]{.yt_code} if you have any
questions. Additionally, we use [slack](https://slack.com) as a
communication platform for development discussions. Feel free to sign up
and [try it](https://yt-project.slack.com/) out.

What To Expect
==============

Contributions to yt go through several stages. Once you\'ve submitted a
pull request, to the source code, the documentation, or even the blog,
you will likely receive comments on it from developers or other
individuals. **Every** pull request gets reviewed, even those issued by
developers that have been with the project for years.

These comments might address stylistic issues, may request changes to
the variable names, may suggest methods of testing, or may even suggest
alternate approaches to solving given problems.

We\'re grateful for every contribution, and we hope to hear from you.

How to Get Started
==================

Here\'s the simplest way to get started contributing to yt. You can
[fork](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/) yt on GitHub, push some
changes to your fork, and issue a pull request.

In the documentation you can find an [an
outline](https://yt-project.org/doc/developing/index.html) of how to
contribute changes, but here are some handy tips and tricks:

-   Use a git branch to track where you are in your development.
-   Push to your repository and issue pull requests from there.
-   Add [tests](https://yt-project.org/doc/developing/testing.html) and
    documentation for new functionality. The tests [are run on every
    pull request](https://tests.yt-project.org/) (yt-fido will let you
    know how your pull request does!)
-   If you get stuck or want feedback, drop by Slack, IRC, or the
    mailing list!

Community Directed Development
==============================

The process of designing yt is conducted through *consensus-oriented*
and *code-driven* discussions. In the waning months of 2012, a process
was somewhat codified for discussing major design decisions and
strategizing about preserving and breaking backwards compatibility.
Large-reaching design discussions and decisions are described in \"yt
Enhancement Proposals\" (YTEPs). These documents are stored in a
[repository](https://github.com/yt-project/ytep), they are discussed
both on the mailing list and through the process of [pull
requests](https://github.com/yt-project/ytep/pulls) and they are meant
to be living documents that reflect how and why changes to fundamental
components of yt are made. The current set of all YTEPs can be found at
[ytep.readthedocs.org](https://ytep.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

Because yt is used for analysis and visualization by a number of
individuals across the globe, we try to avoid breaking existing scripts
and functionality without very good reason. The process of writing,
submitting and iterating on a design document can put overhead on the
process of coding and hacking away, but we want to ensure that yt is a
reliable basis for long-term and stable analysis.

yt Community Code of Conduct
============================

The community of participants in open source Scientific projects is made
up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills,
personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our
community experiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone
in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others
both inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a
positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community.

As members of the community,

-   We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment-
    and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation
    and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size,
    race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual
    language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary
    jokes are not appropriate.
-   We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing
    acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we
    pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or
    acknowledged.
-   We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and
    realize that including people with a variety of opinions and
    backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular,
    discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies,
    programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be
    done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all
    participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely
    express their opinions.
-   We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying
    particular attention to those new to the community. We pledge to
    provide respectful criticisms and feedback in forums, especially in
    discussion threads resulting from code contributions.
-   We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider
    community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive
    to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and
    disagreement, both within our community and where we are criticized.
    We will treat those outside our community with the same respect as
    people within our community.
-   We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct,
    and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of
    conduct. We will take action when members of our community violate
    this code such as contacting confidential\@yt-project.org (all
    emails sent to this address will be treated with the strictest
    confidence) or talking privately with the person.

This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and
offline, including mailing lists, forums, social media, conferences,
meetings, associated social events, and one-to-one interactions.

The yt Community Code of Conduct was adapted from the [Astropy Community
Code of Conduct](https://www.astropy.org/code_of_conduct.html), which
was partially inspired by the PSF code of conduct.
